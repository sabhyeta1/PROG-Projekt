Welome to our PONG Project! This is our version of the classic PONG game. 

Before playing you will need to: 

Copy the absolute file paths for the audio files under our "resources" folder and paste it into these lines of code:
1. game_music.mp3 --> Class "HelloApplication.java", Line 161, playGameMusic(paste your absolute path here)
2. menu_music.mp3 --> Class "GameMenu.java", Line 62, playMenuMusic(paste your absolute path here)
3. single_bounce.mp3 --> Class "Ball.java", Lines 77 & 87, playBounceSound(paste your absolute path here)

   
How to play: 

The game is started via the class "GameMenu". 
It is a local two-player game using the keyboard keys combination of either "W"&"S" or the "UP"&"DOWN" arrow keys to move the paddles. 
Player 1 uses the "W"&"S" key combination and Player 2 uses the "UP"&"DOWN" arrow keys. 

Note: 

Although all of us worked on the code, Masud couldn't commit his code regularly due to technical issues, which is why the rest of us commited his parts for him. 

Bugs to fix: 

There is a delayed response to the bounce sound. 

Victory screen does not show which player has won the game.
