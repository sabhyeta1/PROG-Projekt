Welome to our PONG Project! This is our version of the classic PONG game. 

Before playing you will need to: 

Make sure you are using Java Version 20 to run this game. 

If you want to increase the maximum score of the game, you can change it as so: 
Class "HelloApplication.java", Line 43, static final int MAX_SCORE = 3; (in place of the 3, write the number of points you would like to play for).
   
How to play: 

The game is started via the class "GameMenu". 
It is a local two-player game using the keyboard keys combination of either "W"&"S" or the "UP"&"DOWN" arrow keys to move the paddles. 
Player 1 uses the "W"&"S" key combination and Player 2 uses the "UP"&"DOWN" arrow keys. 

Note: 

Although all of us worked on the code, Masud couldn't commit his code regularly due to technical issues, which is why the rest of us commited his parts for him.

Bugs to fix: 

There is a delayed response to the bounce sound. 

Victory screen does not show which player has won the game. 

Avatar 1 and Avatar 4 need to have their eyes fixed, the background was not removed corectly.
